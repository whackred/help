# Introduction

Whack Red is an entire development suite for client-side WHATWG/W3C web and server-side NodeJS projects using the [ShockScript](https://shockscript.github.io/spec/) language.

Whack Red implements a reactive UI model — called Whack DS — over the DOM with support for a more intricate and dynamically inserted [CSS dialect](https://whackred.github.io/help/css/manual) during runtime.
