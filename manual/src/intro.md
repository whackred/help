# Introduction

Whack Red is an entire development suite for client-side WHATWG/W3C web and server-side NodeJS projects using the [ShockScript](https://github.com/shockscript) language.

Whack Red implements a reactive UI model — called Whack DS — over the DOM with support for a more intricate and dynamically inserted CSS dialect during runtime.
